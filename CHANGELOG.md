# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

These are first-party Kibo templates. Changes to the generated C++ or
Python surface — new projections, renamed outputs, or behavioural shifts
in what is generated — are tracked here.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Breaking — the C++ write direction now names its target type.** Every
  function in `Writer`, `DataHasher`, `ValueEncoder`, `ValueHexdigest` and
  `JsonEncoder` carries the suffix of the type it operates on, mirroring the
  read direction (`Reader`, `ValueDecoder`, `JsonDecoder`, `ValueType`), which
  already did. `writer.write(value)` becomes `writer.write_Ns_Type(value)`,
  `ValueEncoder::encode(value)` becomes `ValueEncoder::encode_Ns_Type(value)`,
  and likewise for `hash` and `hexdigest`. The same-named overload sets are
  gone, and the primitive entry points are renamed to match (`write_string`,
  `hash_uint32`, `encode_uuid`, …). See DESIGN.md §6.1 for the rule and its
  rationale.

  *For generated SDKs* — hand-written code calling these functions must name
  the type. Generated call sites are updated by regeneration alone. The read
  direction, the on-disk format and the runtime contract are unchanged.

  *For modified templates* — 21 `.stg` files are touched, across `cpp/Stream`,
  `cpp/Data`, `cpp/ValueCodec`, `cpp/ValueHasher`, `cpp/Json`,
  `cpp/Attachments`, `cpp/Database`, `cpp/FunctionPool*` and `cpp/Test`. A fork
  carrying local edits there should expect conflicts wherever a `write`,
  `encode`, `hash` or `hexdigest` call appears.

  The motivation is compile time. Resolving a call against N same-named
  overloads makes the compiler prove non-viability for every discarded
  candidate, and a `std::optional<T>` parameter turns each such proof into a
  full constraint evaluation instead of an immediate mismatch — quadratic in
  the number of generated types, and severe enough on some standard-library
  implementations to dominate the build.

- The C++ surface no longer emits any hand-written function template. The
  `hash(std::array<T, n>)` helper is gone, replaced by an explicit nested loop
  in the `mat` hasher that computes the same value.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-17

First standalone release of the first-party Kibo templates for the Viper
ecosystem (the Viper C++ runtime and the `dsviper` Python binding),
consumed by Kibo to generate typed C++ and Python API surfaces.

### Added
- `cpp/` — C++ surface templates (Data, Database, Stream, Json,
  Attachments, FunctionPool, value codecs/types/hashers) targeting the
  Viper C++ API.
- `python/` — Python surface templates targeting the `dsviper` API.
